##### Notes
* This extension uses the GitHub API to get user data. Each new user page visited requires 1 request for their repo list and `<number of repos>` requests for the languages used in each repoâ€“ making a total of `<number of repos> + 1` API requests. 
* Because of the API's rate limit, accessing many profiles *(especially profiles with large amounts of repositories)* in a short amount of time could result in reaching the rate limit. If a request results in a non-ok response, no chart will be injected until requests can be made again.
* Cookies are used to save user data that has already been received within the last hour in order to reduce API requests.
